# csci366-library-project
This was my final project for CSCI 366 - Database Systems from Spring 2022. The project represents a simple Library program. The LibraryClient class interacts with the user through the console giving them various options that then call upon methods from the Data class. The Data class retrieves or updates data from the PostgreSQL Library database and has various methods for processing the tables and views into 2D arrays. The 2D arrays are converted into ASCII tables to output to the user through the console.
